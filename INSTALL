Need to install the autotools of automake and autoconf. In a debian-based linux distro (Ubuntu, etc),
should just need to run as superuser (or use sudo):

apt-get install automake
apt-get install autoconf

You will need the C++ Boost Libraries
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev 

Then in the project directory, run autoreconf -i to have it set up the configure script and install the files it needs.
Then run: ./configure to generate the makefiles.
Then run: make
